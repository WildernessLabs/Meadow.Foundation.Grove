# Meadow.Foundation.Grove

The Meadow.Foundation.Grove peripherals library is an open source repository of Meadow compatible drivers for [Seeed Studio Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/grove.html) modular hardware peripherals. Meadow.Foundation.Grove is part of the open source driver and peripheral library [Meadow.Foundation](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/Peripherals/).

## Meadow.Foundation

The [Meadow.Foundation](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/Peripherals/) peripherals library is an open source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplifiy adding hardware to your .NET Meadow IoT application.

Meadow.Foundation makes the task of building connected things easy with Meadow by providing a unified driver and library framework that includes drivers and abstractions for common peripherals such as: sensors, displays, motors, cameras and more. Additionally, it includes utility functions and helpers for common tasks when building connected things.

## Repositories 

Meadow.Foundation is currently split into three (3) GitHub repos:
1. [Meadow.Foundation](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation/) which contains the majority of the peripheral and library source code
2. [Meadow.Foundation.Featherwings](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.Featherwings/) contains drivers for hardware that conforms to the [Adafruit Featherwing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/) form factor
3. [Meadow.Foundaion.Grove](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation.Grove/) contains drivers for [Seeed Studio Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/grove.html) modular hardware peripherals
