MicroGraphics graphics;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    display = new OLEDDisplay1_12inch(Device.CreateI2cBus(), OLEDDisplayVersion.Version3x);

    graphics = new MicroGraphics(display)
    {
        CurrentFont = new Font8x8(),
        Rotation = RotationType._180Degrees
    };

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override Task Run()
{
    graphics.Clear();
    graphics.DrawRectangle(0, 0, graphics.Width, graphics.Height, false);
    graphics.DrawTriangle(10, 10, 50, 50, 10, 50, false);
    graphics.DrawRectangle(20, 15, 40, 20, true);
    graphics.DrawText(5, 5, "SH1107");
