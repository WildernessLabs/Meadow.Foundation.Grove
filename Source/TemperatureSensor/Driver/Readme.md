# Meadow.Foundation.Grove.Sensors.Temperature.TemperatureSensor

**Grove temperature sensor**

The **TemperatureSensor** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.Grove.Sensors.Temperature.TemperatureSensor** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

For more information on developing for Meadow, visit [developer.wildernesslabs.co](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/).

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.Grove.Sensors.Temperature.TemperatureSensor`
## Usage

```csharp
TemperatureSensor sensor;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize...");

    sensor = new TemperatureSensor(Device.Pins.A01);

    var consumer = TemperatureSensor.CreateObserver(
        handler: result =>
        {
            Resolver.Log.Info($"Observer filter satisfied - " +
                $"new: {result.New.Millivolts:N2}mV, " +
                $"old: {result.Old?.Millivolts:N2}mV");
        },
        filter: result =>
        {
            if (result.Old is { } old)
            {   //c# 8 pattern match syntax. checks for !null and assigns var.
                return (result.New - old).Abs().Millivolts > 500;
            }
            return false;
        });
    sensor.Subscribe(consumer);

    sensor.Updated += (sender, result) =>
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info($"Voltage Changed, new: {result.New.Millivolts:N2}mV, old: {result.Old?.Millivolts:N2}mV");
    };

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    var result = await sensor.Read();
    Resolver.Log.Info($"Initial read: {result.Millivolts:N2}mV");

    sensor.StartUpdating(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
}

```
